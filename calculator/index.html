    <h1>Calculator</h1>

    <!---
    When we click submit, the data gets posted to the location of action.
    If you don't have 'action' the form will send its data to whatever page it is currently on.
    In this case, we're showing this page of html on the root route of localhost:3000.
    If that's where we want the form information to be posted (which it is) then  we don't
    technically need the 'action' attribute but we're including it anyway for clarity's sake.

    <form action="/" method="post">
      <input type="text" name="n1" placeholder="First Number">
      <input type="text" name="n2" placeholder="Second Number">
      <button type="submit" name="submit">Calculate</button>
    </form>
